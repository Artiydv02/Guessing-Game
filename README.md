# Guessing-Game

Join me in learning how to create a guessing game in Python!

I have created an a fun and interactive guessing game in Python. The game involves the user guessing a randomly selected number and receiving feedback on their guesses. We'll explore the process of generating random numbers using the 'random' module, understand the 'randint' function, and implement a while loop to continue the game until a certain condition is met. Additionally, we will see  the logic behind the game, the use of conditional statements, and the importance of dividing code into small modules for easy understanding and editing.
